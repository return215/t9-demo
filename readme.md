# Predictive Text Interface

Predictive text (T9) Java GUI project.

This is the third quiz in Object Oriented Programming subject. This is a team project. We use Java 8 to create the program.

## Working on the project

To work on this project, you need at least Java 8 JDK. We use Eclipse to work on this project, but you can work on it even with other IDEs/editors.

### Eclipse users

After cloning the project into tour system, import it using "File > Export > Projects from Folder or Archive" and select the directory of that project. Run scripts can be accessed directly through the Eclipse menus.

### Non-Eclipse users

We provide you with some Bash scripts to help with development, namely `build.sh` and `run.sh`. If you are on Windows and have installed Git, you should be able to run this using Git Bash. For Linux and macOS users, Bash should already exist on your system. If not, you can install that separately.

- `build.sh` builds the project. This must be executed before running any Java program.
- `run.sh` runs a class that you specify. You can also pass program arguments here.
